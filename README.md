# Revenue-KPI-Dashboard-Leela-Palace
Developed an interactive KPI dashboard for "The Leela Palace" hotel chain using Power BI during my internship. The project involved data collection, cleaning, and modeling to showcase revenue trends, occupancy rates, and key KPIs, enabling data-driven decisions.
Here’s the converted version in the format you provided earlier:

Data Source:  
Data provided by "The Leela Palace" (March–May 2024) in Excel/CSV format.  


Steps Involved:  

1. Data Collection 
- Gathered data on revenue, occupancy rates, and departmental performance (rooms, dining, events).  

2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats using **Power Query** in Power BI and Excel.  

3. Data Transformation and Modeling 
- Created relationships between tables.  
- Calculated key metrics using **DAX** (e.g., Total Revenue, Average Spend, Occupancy Rates).  

4. Dashboard Design and Development  
- Built an interactive dashboard using **Power BI** featuring:  
  - **KPIs**: Total Revenue, Revenue by Category, Occupancy Rates, Average Customer Rating.  
  - **Filters**: Time Period, Department, and Location.
